README

Self-balancing efficient portafolio: 

Project definition:A python tool to create an efficient portfolio based on the Markowitz theory using yfinance library to pull stock quotes 

Data Science Scope:
* Time series
* Linear Regression
* Normality test
* Linear Optimization

Skills requiered to develop
* Statistics
* Finance Investment Basics
* Python libraries: Pandas, Numpy, yfinance
* Supervised Learning. 
* Cloud: Batch Processing / Near Real Time and Containerzation.

Steps
* Create a model that downloads daily stock quotes from the market
* Create a model that stores stock quotes. 
* Create a model that constantly recalculates the risk and reward ratios for each stock
* Create a model that shows the efficient frontier for different risk levels as a PDF
